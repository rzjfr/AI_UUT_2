AI Programming Assignment
=================

this is a solution for a programming assignment AI(Artificial Intelligence) course in fall 2012. this is a legacy code that has been written naively and i think is a good case to practice refactoring in python.
i'm planning to make corrections and improvements to some of my old codes during my leisure time.

##Problem description
the aim is to solve a  polynomial equation with genetic algorithm. finding only one of the roots is sufficient.
the expression is given via a text file. the first line of the file are the coefficients (separated by space) and second line are the degrees.
